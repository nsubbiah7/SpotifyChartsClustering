# nsubbiah7SpotifyChartsClustering
This project looks at the current Spotify Top 50 playlists for each country and groups the countries into clusters using K-Means clustering using metadata surrounding the attributes of the songs (energy, danceability etc.). It also allows the user to rank the countries based on similarity to their own recently listened to songs.
